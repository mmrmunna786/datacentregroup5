TO DO

The country flavour text works but need a more formal definition of each countries stats,

make a way of including cooling

Need to to account for yearly carbon positive effect of wind and solar

take co2 emitted, display
consider a 10 year lifecycle
compare to using fossil fules for 10 years
give net carbon negativity

Add text -
Add hyperscale datacentre and bit about google etc
where the numbers were found

         Thank you for visiting our Datacenter Designer&nbsp; Web Application <br/><br/>
         This is a simple and intuitive web app where you can easily choose your desired location from the dropdown menu. <br>  <br>
         Then choose an estimated size for your datacenter from the dropdown menu. <br> <br>
         Then select an energy mix equal to your datacentres required yearly energy in GWh <br> <br>
         Solar and wind assumes building on-site renewable energy generators, which has a one time cost and C02 emission but then has no impact in later years<br /><br />
         Other power sources assume purchasing energy off of the local grid, different types are available for different locales.<br /><br />
          
         After filling in your energy mix choices you will be presented by initial and rolling cost and C02 emissions, as well as land area needed for renewables built.<br /><br /> 
          
         For example, a small datacenter which requires 2 GWh of energy could yeild the following information, depending on locale: <br> <br>

          <p>
          <h1>Final Emission Calculation</h1> <br><br>
          
            Your datacentre would build <strong>28,571</strong> m2 of solar farm.<br><br>

            Your datacentre's cost for building renewables is: <strong>£11,000,000</strong><br><br>

            After building renewables in the 1st year your rolling energy costs would be: <strong>£1,000,000</strong><br><br>

            Your datacentre's initial CO₂ emissions: <strong>500.0 metric tons</strong><br><br>

            Your datacentre's yearly CO₂ emissions: <strong>490.0 metric tons</strong> <br><br>

        <strong>Tips</strong><br /><br />

        

          Locations are ranked on their energy potential for solar and wind energy, and on their availability for nuclear, geothermal and hydroelectric.<br /><br />

          Geothermal and hydroelectric are the cleanest rolling energy type in terms of C02, and are often fairly cheap, but their availability is limited by locale.<br /><br />

          Nuclear is quite green and many of the locales have some access to it.<br /><br />

          Fossil fuel based energy is available to all locales but is by far the most carbon intensive choice.<br /><br />

          In brighter locales solar provides a good amount of energy and takes up less space than wind. Solar is a one-time build cost and C02 output, meaning the more you build the better your costs in the years after construction.<br /><br />

          Wind is a reliable and long-term green source of energy, but it is expensive and occupies a lot of space. Consider using wind to augment an energy mix rather than powering you entire datacentre with it.<br /><br />

          Try powering your datacentre off of exclusively one type of power to see the differences between energy types, then try to find a good mix that minimises long term yearly costs and CO2 by using the greenest energy source in your locale mixed with some construction of on site renewables like wind and solar.<br /><br />

            <strong>Data Used</strong><br /><br />

              Data for our calculations requires specific cost of constructing large scale wind and solar farms for all of our location options.<br /><br />

              Exact costs are difficult to calculate, and will vary depending on the size of renewables built and the economics of the area in question.<br /><br />

              We have tried to estimate cost of 1m squared of solar and 1km squared of wind based on other large scale projects that have been realised in a each, specifc, locale.<br /><br />

              Additionally, data on costs of nuclear, fossil, geothermal and hydroelectric power is difficult to estimate, with available data pertaining mostly to household use in each locale, but this data is enough to at least estimate the cost of energy needed for a larger scale project such as a datacentre.<br /><br />
