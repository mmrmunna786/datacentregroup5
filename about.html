          <!-- Add a bit more info on the webapp about how to use it (its simple,
          but a bit of text explaining better that you can buy energy for a
          yearly cost or build renewables up front)  -->
        
         This simple and intuitive web app estimates energy costs for different sized datacentres accross different locales. <br>  <br>
         Choose a location, then an estimated size for your datacenter from the dropdown menus. <br> <br>
         Select an energy mix equal to your datacentres required yearly energy in GWh <br> <br>
         Solar and wind assumes building on-site renewable energy generators, which has a one time cost and C02 emission but then has no impact in later years<br /><br />
         Other power sources assume purchasing energy off of the local grid, different types are available for different locales.<br /><br />
          
         After filling in your energy mix choices you will be presented by initial and rolling cost and C02 emissions, as well as land area needed for renewables built.<br /><br /> 
          
         For example, a small datacenter in Iceland using solar and geothermal would output: <br> <br>

          <h1>Final Emission Calculation</h1> <br><br>
            <p>
            Your datacentre would build <strong>2,857</strong> m2 of solar farm.<br><br>

            Your datacentre's cost for building renewables is: <strong>£1,050,000</strong><br><br>

            After building renewables in the 1st year your rolling energy costs would be: <strong>£50,000</strong><br><br>

            Your datacentre's initial CO₂ emissions: <strong>50.0 metric tons</strong><br><br>

            Your datacentre's yearly CO₂ emissions: <strong>45.0 metric tons</strong> <br><br>

        <p class="about-info">

          Locations are ranked on their energy potential for solar and wind energy, and on their availability for nuclear, geothermal and hydroelectric.<br /><br />

          Geothermal and hydroelectric are the cleanest rolling energy type in terms of C02, and are often fairly cheap, but their availability is limited by locale.<br /><br />

          Nuclear is quite green and many of the locales have some access to it.<br /><br />

          Fossil fuel based energy is available to all locales but is by far the most carbon intensive choice.<br /><br />

          In brighter locales solar provides a good amount of energy and takes up less space than wind. Solar is a one-time build cost and C02 output, meaning the more you build the better your costs in the years after construction.<br /><br />

          Wind is a reliable and long-term green source of energy, but it is expensive and occupies a lot of space. Consider using wind to augment an energy mix rather than powering you entire datacentre with it.<br /><br />

          Try powering your datacentre off of exclusively one type of power to see the differences between energy types, then try to find a good mix that minimises long term yearly costs and CO2 by using the greenest energy source in your locale mixed with some construction of on site renewables like wind and solar.<br /><br />
